#Alec George Raid: Number guessing game


#program will get a random number between one and ten, and the user keeps guessing numbers until they get it right, it will tell them too high or too low, and will tell them how many guesses it took to get it right

#to get random number, needs random library
import random

#needs variables for random number, user input, possible inputs, already guessed inputs
